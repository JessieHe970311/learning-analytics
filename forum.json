I just think that assessment only refers to a means of evaluation. However, after the class session, I learned that three different expressions mean different meanings. The following is my understanding. Assessment of learning is simply a judgment, or score. Assessment for learning focuses on evidence. The purpose is to give feedback, and then students can further improve. I personally think that this is similar to the purpose of evaluation. Assessment as learning is the learning process. While completing this process, it also provides evidence.</p><p><br /></p><p>Post-class\uff1a</p><p>This week\u2019s key reading is <i>Applying Learning Outcomes Concepts to Higher Education: An Overview</i> written by Peter Ewell.\u00a0<span style=\"font-size:.9375rem;\">Through reading, I have plenty of new understandings of learning outcomes and related concepts.</span></p><p><br /></p><p>The first concept is learning outcomes. In the past, when talking about outcomes, I haven\u2019t thought deeper about it. This article clarified that not all learning results can be called learning outcomes. Some will be classified as outputs, for example, Numbers of graduates, numbers of teaching hours generated by a faculty, or types of service or research products, etc. Therefore, after reading, I found that when thinking about learning outcomes, I actually did not have a clear understanding of the definition of learning outcomes.</p><p><span style=\"font-size:.9375rem;\">Secondly, the article also talks about assessment and evidence. As I said before, I only thought that assessment only represented a standard scoring method, that is, a test or an exam. And evidence means that the score of the test, or the product students made. After reading this article, I learned basic concepts related to evidence. Evidence is not only the result of the standard examination, it also includes natural forms, such as Student Work (e.g. portfolio), Self-Reports, etc. It allows non-standardized qualitative information to enter this judgment because it emphasizes that the compiled information can be extracted from multiple sources. Combined with Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy, I think that in order to gain the evidence of attitude outcomes, we should pay attention to assessment choosing. This helps us to provide a reference for the detailed design of the mini-course in the future.\u00a0</span><br /></p><p><br /></p><p></p><br />", "messageformat": "1", "messagetrust": "0", "attachment": null, "totalscore": "0", "mailnow": "0", "privatereplyto": "0", "ratings": null}}, "discussion_subs": {"discussion_sub": {"@id": "7238", "userid": "7475", "preference": "1611379509"}}}, {"@id": "9244", "name": "One question about group design studio", "firstpost": "29593", "userid": "7974", "groupid": "-1", "assessed": "0", "timemodified": "1611499940", "usermodified": "8014", "timestart": "0", "timeend": "0", "pinned": "0", "timelocked": "0", "posts": {"post": [{"@id": "29593", "parent": "0", "userid": "7974", "created": "1611393450", "modified": "1611393860", "mailed": "1", "subject": "One question about group design studio", "message": "<p>Hi, everyone,\u00a0<span style=\"font-size:.9375rem;\">I don't quite understand this problem,could you please give me some help?\u00a0</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:.9375rem;\"><img src=\"@@PLUGINFILE@@/design%20studio.png\" alt=\"design studio\" width=\"795\" height=\"79\" class=\"img-responsive atto_image_button_middle\" /><br /></span></p><p>I'm not quite sure whether the \"role\" in this is defined by the team members or the roles released by the teacher and selected by the team members freely?</p><p>Thanks.</p>", "messageformat": "1", "messagetrust": "0", "attachment": null, "totalscore": "0", "mailnow": "0", "privatereplyto": "0", "ratings": null}, {"@id": "29595", "parent": "29593", "userid": "7537", "created": "1611394550", "modified": "1611394550", "mailed": "1", "subject": "Re: One question about group design studio", "message": "<div class=\"text_to_html\">Hi Wang Peiyu, I guess it is like when a group of members belongs to part of the course design team, how we would take up different roles to plan and construct the entire learning design product?</div>", "messageformat": "1", "messagetrust": "0", "attachment": null, "totalscore": "0", "mailnow": "0", "privatereplyto": "0", "ratings": null}, {"@id": "29633", "parent": "29593", "userid": "8014", "created": "1611499940", "modified": "1611499940", "mailed": "1", "subject": "Re: One question about group design studio", "message": "<div class=\"text_to_html\">Hi Peiyun, thanks for you question, as far as I am concerned, each member are taking different role and using their expertise to contribute to the group, for example, in our group, we have the roles such as pedagogical supporter, curriculum designer, Teacher, and multimedia developer.</div>", "messageformat": "1", "messagetrust": "0", "attachment": null, "totalscore": "0", "mailnow": "0", "privatereplyto": "0", "ratings": null}]}, "discussion_subs": {"discussion_sub": [{"@id": "7247", "userid": "7537", "preference": "1611394550"}, {"@id": "7258", "userid": "7974", "preference": "1611406663"}]}}, {"@id": "9245", "name": "The Process of Learning Design", "firstpost": "29594", "userid": "7537", "groupid": "-1", "assessed": "0", "timemodified": "1611568353", "usermodified": "7535", "timestart": "0", "timeend": "0", "pinned": "0", "timelocked": "0", "posts": {"post": [{"@id": "29594", "parent": "0", "userid": "7537", "created": "1611394209", "modified": "1611416333", "mailed": "1", "subject": "The Process of Learning Design", "message": "<p>From Session 1, we have come across the two course level design principles, naming \"Backward course design model\" and \"constructive alignment principle\".

In mainland China, there is a strong concept called \"unit\" in school education. Before every semester, teachers will meet together to decide the \"Goals\" for next period, which include education goals and teaching goals (the latter conforms the former). According to the educational goals, teachers will design topics of teaching plan every week and month for each unit to realize them step by step, especially for the goals of attitudes.

We can promotelearners' understanding of the content through design instead of merelystacking content and activities together. Therefore, we need to think from learners'perspective so that it is more likely to realize the effective transfer ofknowledge, rather than just writing expectations on paper. Specifically, thereare the following:</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">First, we needto identify goals. The goal should be clear, clearly targeted, and take intoaccount the core knowledge and skills that learners need to master. Secondly,determine acceptable evidence. At this stage, we not only need to consider theevaluation, but also the goal, that is, what kind of evidence is required forthe assessment to promote the further improvement of learners, whether evidenceis identifiable to monitor progress, and which areas need further improvement topropose targeted and better improvement programs. At last, plan learning experiencesand instruction accordingly. Here we need to consider what kind of activitiescan help us achieve the expected goals, what verbs are convenient for us tobetter recognize when we evaluate later, how the process should be monitored,etc..</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">Learning todesign is not an overnight task, it needs constant debugging and modificationto realize the effective transfer of knowledge. However, it should be notedthat when learning design, we must always maintain that the core of the threestages is consistent. In other words, the evidence in phase two should servethe established goals of phase one, and the activities and events of phasethree should be consistent with the goals of phase one and the assessment ofphase two.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">As for how tomonitor and promote the improvement of learning design, I think it can bemainly from the following aspects: </span></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">First of all,through the feedback of learners to realize the shortcomings and advantages ofour learning design and make adjustments according to learners' needs andcharacteristics, so as to recognize that \"we are all students and we areall teachers.\" Secondly, we can view and identify our progress and defectsin learning design based on our teaching design log, activity records, etc.,that is, the specific teaching process and related evidence, so as to maketargeted improvements. Last but not least, learning from teachers with experienceor fruitful results, maybe through consultation or observation during worktogether, etc., to selectively integrate other people's excellent aspects into ourown learning design practice.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">Besides, Ihave more clearly realized the importance of assessment in learning design.\"assessment as learning\", \"assessment of learning\" and\"assessment for learning\" all include the evaluation of learnerresults, but their focus is completely different.

Forexample, if we want to enhance student\u2019s ability in oral presentation, thelearning design that completing a declarative assessment on paper may beunsuitable. The constructive alignment raised by John B. Biggs, considered thelearning design process and suggests learning outcomes, teaching and learning activitiesand the assessments can't be designed independently.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">To have a more comprehensive considerationof learning outcomes, Bloom's and SOLO taxonomy could be used.\u00a0 Bloom's taxonomy uses a systematic classificationto assign different kinds of learning outcomes such as \"knowledge\",\"comprehension\", \"application\" and so on in cognitiveperspective. SOLO taxonomy seems to focus on how learners process the learntinformation that how learners integrate knowledge. For the pre-structuralstage, learners could only understand the provided learning resources and for the extended abstract stage, learners could not only connect the knowledge amongdifferent subjects but also transform them into a higher level.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">In my view, to consider learning outcomesin a relatively long study period, we could choose Bloom's taxonomy as it providesrelatively abundant classification of different kinds of improvement ofstudents. If the learning period is relatively short, for example, it just hasone session course, or be processed in micro-learning form, SOLO taxonomy couldbe better, as is provide a clear guide of different level of study experience.</span></p><p><b><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">Learning Journal</span></b></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">After thelecture on Monday, I read the provided articles.

It required me to distinguish learning outputs and learning outcomes.At first, I thought learning output belong to a result that could be scaled innumber, and learning outcome is a more abstract thing that requires a more diverse evaluationmethod to judge. However, because I wrote many times wrong answers in question9, I read this part in the article more times and found we could conclude thesetwo terms in a clearer way in usage aspect. For output, it is used for the evaluative purpose for institutional selection; for outcomes, it is morerelated to students themselves in education perspective, for example, how theyapply and use the knowledge and how the knowledge changes them.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">After finishthe quiz, our groupmate gathered together online to discuss the grouppresentation.

Consequently, our students were passive in their learning process.All that they were doing in class was just following the teacher's instructionsin the activities, or copying the teachers' slides and notes without focus.After class, when we teachers assigned some homework, a few of the studentswere still at a loss. It seemed to them that the in-class activities and noteshad nothing to do with their homework. When correcting their homework, we teacherswere at a loss too, because we could not understand why this homework would besuch a disaster, and what was wrong with our teaching. </span></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">\u00a0</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">The concept of the Backward Course DesignModel gave me an insight into how to deal with this problem. Before preparingthe teaching materials and activities, we should figure out what we would likeour students to produce by using what they have learned in our class. In otherwords, their after-class product is exactly the evidence to demonstrate their learningoutcomes. What\u2019s more, we should clearly explain to our students what we expectthem to deliver after the course. This explanation should be given before we officiallykick off the course. From the students\u2019 perspective, this is explicit andstraightforward.

Learning outcome is a broader idea, while learning objectives are used to organize specific topics or individual learning activities<br />to achieve the overall learning outcome.For example, in a course for learning scratch, the LO might be what the students are going to achieve after the course, while the objectives might be some thing like: session 1 objectives: learn to use motion block, and form a team of 5 people.<br />2. Learning objectives are usually viewed from the instructor\u2019s perspective (what does the instructor want to accomplish?) while learning outcomes are seen more from the learner\u2019s perspective (what will the course teach me, as a learner?). Of course, the two are closely related, because a trainer\u2019s objectives will ultimately be translated into the learner\u2019s outcomes, as long as the course successfully serves its purpose.<br />In my opinion, I prefer the 2nd understanding, as in Session 1 we just learned the difference between instructional design and learning design, so I think it is more easy for me to understand.</div>", "messageformat": "1", "messagetrust": "0", "attachment": null, "totalscore": "0", "mailnow": "0", "privatereplyto": "0", "ratings": {"rating": {"@id": "39479", "component": "mod_forum", "ratingarea": "post", "scaleid": "-44", "value": "1", "userid": "7479", "timecreated": "1611557882", "timemodified": "1611557882"}}}]}, "discussion_subs": {"discussion_sub": [{"@id": "7300", "userid": "7479", "preference": "1611545937"}, {"@id": "7306", "userid": "8012", "preference": "1611553477"}, {"@id": "7318", "userid": "8003", "preference": "1611558222"}]}}, {"@id": "9270", "name": "Should analysis of learners come first before setting learning outcomes?", "firstpost": "29649", "userid": "7536", "groupid": "-1", "assessed": "0", "timemodified": "1612071251", "usermodified": "7535", "timestart": "0", "timeend": "0", "pinned": "0", "timelocked": "0", "posts": {"post": [{"@id": "29649", "parent": "0", "userid": "7536", "created": "1611549601", "modified": "1611549601", "mailed": "1", "subject": "Should analysis of learners come first before setting learning outcomes?", "message": "<p></p><p>In the first lesson, we learnt about the \"backward design model\".

For the first one, the very first stepis to identify the desired results and then we can move to step 2 and 3. Therefore,the learning outcomes we discuss in this session are essential to our coursedesigning. LOs will definitely affect each part of learning design.

In this regard, the PBL seems relatively strategic, i.e. providing more autonomy to learners, than PrBL.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:.9375rem;font-family:'-apple-system', BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji';\">Please share your thoughts on these 2 approaches.\u00a0</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:.9375rem;font-family:'-apple-system', BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji';\">Cheers,</span></p><p>Ryan</p>", "messageformat": "1", "messagetrust": "0", "attachment": null, "totalscore": "0", "mailnow": "0", "privatereplyto": "0", "ratings": {"rating": {"@id": "39490", "component": "mod_forum", "ratingarea": "post", "scaleid": "-44", "value": "1", "userid": "8003", "timecreated": "1612115785", "timemodified": "1612115785"}}}, {"@id": "29884", "parent": "29851", "userid": "8003", "created": "1612115774", "modified": "1612115774", "mailed": "1", "subject": "Re: Difference of PLB vs PrBL?", "message": "<div class=\"text_to_html\">Hi Ryan!<br />I think your understanding is very impressing, and I have an understanding from different sight.

The triangle is divided into three parts: Learning outcomes, Disciplinary practice and Pedagogical approach. This is different from the design model learned in the past. One of the confusing points is the Disciplinary practice. After inquiries and discussions with the group members, I now think that it means that as designers, we should provide a task related to the actual problem scenario to facilitate the learners' in-depth study. This helps us to think about what kind of ability and skill the learner should have when we design, so as to design the learning experience more reasonably. Also, in the knowledge era, 21st-century skills are also needed to be considered.</p><p><br /></p><p>Post-class:</p><p>After reading the article <i>INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN AND LEARNING DESIGN</i>, I think it mentions two very key terms: design pattern and pattern language. This is also what makes me feel confused and difficult to understand. The following is my personal understanding.</p><p><br /></p><p>First, Design pattern is written in pattern language. Design pattern is generic, hierarchically structured organizations. It identifies recurring problems in the real context, not just problems in a specific course. It is a more abstract description. It can even be used by teachers of different disciplines at the same time, because it is proposed from a general level and links the sequence of learning activities and related conditions and resources. I think this may be of great help to cross-disciplinary curriculum development.</p><p><br /></p><p>In <i>Educational design and networked learning: Patterns, pattern languages and design practice</i>, I learned Pedagogical philosophy/learning theory, Pedagogical approach, Pedagogical strategy and Pedagogical tactics.\u00a0</p><p><br /></p><p>Pedagogical philosophy/learning theory is the highest layer in the design framework. It includes many beliefs. For example Constructivism. The second layer is the Pedagogical approach. Pedagogical approach is the embodiment of Pedagogical philosophy in specific teaching settings. Problem-based learning, project-based learning, self-directed learning, etc. belong to this layer.\u00a0 This layer also involves the sequence of Curriculum components. CC is an important concept in learning design. It involves how to combine disciplinary practice and pedagogical approach, and it actually matches the expected learning outcomes.\u00a0<span style=\"font-size:.9375rem;\">I think CC is difficult to understand. It needs to reflect LO, but it is not a direct expression of LO. And because disciplinary practice contains actual problem scenarios, CC also needs to reflect how it relates to reality.\u00a0</span></p><p><br /></p><p>If you have any ideas about CC, I hope to communicate with you more.</p>", "messageformat": "1", "messagetrust": "0", "attachment": null, "totalscore": "0", "mailnow": "0", "privatereplyto": "0", "ratings": null}}, "discussion_subs": {"discussion_sub": {"@id": "7503", "userid": "7475", "preference": "1612083374"}}}, {"@id": "9388", "name": "Insights on Learning Design Triangle", "firstpost": "29879", "userid": "7537", "groupid": "-1", "assessed": "0", "timemodified": "1612098574", "usermodified": "7537", "timestart": "0", "timeend": "0", "pinned": "0", "timelocked": "0", "posts": {"post": {"@id": "29879", "parent": "0", "userid": "7537", "created": "1612098574", "modified": "1612194009", "mailed": "1", "subject": "Insights on Learning Design Triangle", "message": "<p>There are some insights on the topic of Course Level Design.</p><p>First of all, the Learning Design Triangle has provided me a new perspective by seeing learning design from a more holistic view. This is a multi-dimensional model that allows learning designers to consider not only the element of Learning Outcomes, but also Pedagogical Approach and Disciplinary Practice. This is different from my usual way of course design in terms of a relatively linear process. By using this model, the course being designed should be more structured, comprehensive and most importantly, learner-centric.</p><p>Next, there have been discussions on Curriculum Components. My view is that these can help to form a logical sequence of the entire course. Such components should be driven by the detailed Learning Outcomes that are intended to be achieved, while considering the Disciplinary Practice which is related to the Pedagogical Approach. It seems not easy to figure out what the Curriculum Components are, as learners perhaps focused on the Task Level of a designed course. Nonetheless, I believe that such components need to be carefully drafted so that the course design process can reach the intended goal.</p><p>Finally, it is worth noting that along the course design journey, the different and flowing chains of thoughts may easily result in drifting away from the originally agreed ideas. While creativity is valued, it is also important to think thoroughly and feasibly on the desired results and stay focused on the learning outcomes and target audience.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Teddy Tam</p><p><span class=\"edited\">(Edited by <a href=\"https://moodle.edu.hku.hk/user/view.php?id=7557&amp;course=666\">CHEN Minghui Daisy</a> - original submission Sunday, 31 January 2021, 9:09 PM)</span></p>", "messageformat": "1", "messagetrust": "0", "attachment": null, "totalscore": "0", "mailnow": "0", "privatereplyto": "0", "ratings": null}}, "discussion_subs": {"discussion_sub": [{"@id": "7509", "userid": "7537", "preference": "1612098574"}, {"@id": "7539", "userid": "7557", "preference": "1612194010"}]}}, {"@id": "9389", "name": "Session 2 reflection", "firstpost": "29880", "userid": "7996", "groupid": "-1", "assessed": "0", "timemodified": "1612539035", "usermodified": "7996", "timestart": "0", "timeend": "0", "pinned": "0", "timelocked": "0", "posts": {"post": [{"@id": "29880", "parent": "0", "userid": "7996", "created": "1612102662", "modified": "1612102662", "mailed": "1", "subject": "Session 2 reflection", "message": "<p></p><p><b><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">Learning Reflection</span></b></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">For the termthat disciplinary practice (DP), it seemed hard for me to understand at first.Though according to its description, it seemed a different thing compared with the pedagogical approach (PA), when I designed the mini-course with my groupmate,we found they have some similar places - PA may include some teachingstrategies that been used in the selected DP.

Please share yourthoughts below :)</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">The first thing is about the term \u201cStrategiccurriculum component\u201d (SCC) and \u201ccurriculum component\u201d (CC). When I have discussionwith other classmates, all of us are confused with the two terms. After readingthe material provided to us, I came up with new thoughts. I believe that theyare of the same definition. According the definition of SCC (introduced to uson session 2), SCC means that each component is a coherent set of tasksconstituting an identifiable step in the pedagogical approach consistent withthe design context, and it targets specific outcome goals and has its ownstructure of learning tasks and resources design etc. Referring to Law &amp;Liang\u2019s (2020) paper, I realize the CC is the sequence of adopting pedagogicalapproach to promote learners to experience disciplinary practice process inorder to achieve the corresponding learning outcomes. To summarize, thedefinition of SCC actually matches the meaning of CC.</span></p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">Another thing is about the disciplinary practice(DP) of 6330. Basically, I learn design of dementia mini course, I found the DPis the part of LO2 (disciplinary skills) learners need to achieve. That is tosay, DP of this course is the Heath Communication Strategy. Meanwhile, the disciplinaryskill (LO2) is to apply the Heath Communication Strategy.

I think the CC sequence need to be consistent with the sequence of stages in the DP cycle, because you need to complete the cycle to address your real world problem.As for the alignment of CC and PA, there could be in two ways:</p><p>1. For each of the CC, go around the PA stages. For instance, in MITE6330 course, we address one CC for each session, and we experience a whole constructionist inquiry cycle for each session.</p><p>2. The CC1 align with the first few stages of pedagogical approach, but I think the sequence might not change, because the sequence for each PA has its own interrelationship. For example, in problem-based learning, you need to identify the problem, then know about the deficiencies, then learn new knowledge and hence apply it. It can not be changed, you can not learn new knowledge before you identify the facts of it. But you can partly improve it to fit in your design. For example, in PBL, the model we used tells us to conducted self-directed learning, but are they suitable for 4th grade students? We doubted that and adjusted it partly, and that could be fine when we talk about the alignment.

As I majored in special education in my graduate degree and mytarget learners may with emotional, behavioral, or intellectual problems, the mostfamiliar pedagogical philosophy for me is behaviorism and cognitivism. Forexample, I learnt applied behavior analysis (ABA), functional behavior assessment(FBA), and cognitive behavioral interventions (CBI) to enhance learners\u2019behavior and emotion regulation in a course. When I got to know the learning designframework, the first thing that came to my head is that it is too delicate. It isreally learner-centered and provides very pinpoint analysis according to theneeds of course. Because I\u2019m not very familiar with the framework (and now I\u2019malso not very familiar with the framework), before this lecture, I thought the toleranceof error in the designed course may be low. The design framework seems to requireus to have good control during the lecture.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">However, this week I learnt task taxonomyand find the learning design framework increases its tolerance of error in thetask and activity design. Though these two terms seem similar, the definition ofthem is different that learning tasks are what educators set and learningactivity is what students actually do. In last lecture, I wrongly assumed that learningoutcomes (LO) will align and achieve with the design of curriculum components (CC)because the design procedure of CC is based on learning outcomes. With thewrong assumption, I thought that the design procedure has a vacancy of preparationfor the error in education.</span><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\"> </span><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">This week, with the involvement of tasktaxonomy and question 10 in the quiz, I finally know that LO will align with CCwhen the CC tasks are designed according to the learning outcomes. With thiskind of link, I think the tolerance of error will be represented in the designprocess of learning tasks and learning activities. The change of thought let mestart to have a sketch in the learning design.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">I felt the difference of constructivism ineducation compared with the pedagogy I learnt before when I learn the design oftasks. Constructivism focuses on how we let learners really learn something andwill have deep thinking in how the knowledge is imparted to learners. In my view,instead of transmitting information directly, it recommends us to let target grouplearn by doing. For example, in \u201cexploratory learning\u201d, learners may be providedwith some hard knowledge resources while these resources may not be directed tothe assessment which requires learners to explore the answer by themselves. </span></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">\u00a0</span></p><p><b><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">Learning Journal</span></b></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">This week Ispend lots of time searching for the answer to question 8 and 10.

Yet, I have a slightly different view from Teddy on medium structure activities. To me, activities that students explore, consolidate and/or present information themselves while effective feedback is provided by instructors/ facilitator shall be classified as medium structure. The key is the feedback itself.<br /><br />I doubt there's a relation between the LO and the structure activity. For example, a LO \"recall the characteristics of PBL\", the task design can be students to search PBL characteristics online (low structure, information exploration) or a lecture (high structure, receiving and interpreting information).  However, I assumed the choice of activity structure depends on how we want students to learn, i.e. the PA in the LDT.<br /><br />Feel free to share thoughts.</div>", "messageformat": "1", "messagetrust": "0", "attachment": null, "totalscore": "0", "mailnow": "0", "privatereplyto": "0", "ratings": {"rating": {"@id": "39501", "component": "mod_forum", "ratingarea": "post", "scaleid": "-44", "value": "1", "userid": "7537", "timecreated": "1613618593", "timemodified": "1613618593"}}}, {"@id": "30217", "parent": "30216", "userid": "7537", "created": "1613618332", "modified": "1613618358", "mailed": "1", "subject": "Re: Question about low/medium/high structure activity", "message": "<div class=\"text_to_html\">Hi Circle and Zhaohui<br /><br />You have a great point regarding the degree of feedback. In a low structure activity the feedback are mainly given and further discussed among participants. With that, a deeper level of understanding of the knowledge can be gained. In a relatively higher structured activity, the feedback will then be moderated and clarified by facilitators so that learning can be further consolidated.<br /><br />I also agree that given the same LOs being achieved, under a particular PA the level of activity structure may vary, depending on our target audience. A problem scenario is what a key component is under PBL, while how such key component can be brought out could be through low/ medium/ high structure activity.<br /><br />Happy to explore more together : )<br /></div><div class=\"text_to_html\"><br /></div><div class=\"text_to_html\">Teddy Tam</div>", "messageformat": "1", "messagetrust": "0", "attachment": null, "totalscore": "0", "mailnow": "0", "privatereplyto": "0", "ratings": null}, {"@id": "30219", "parent": "30204", "userid": "7475", "created": "1613619099", "modified": "1613619211", "mailed": "1", "subject": "Re: Question about low/medium/high structure activity", "message": "<div class=\"text_to_html\">Hi, Zhaohui, Teddy and Circle,<br /><br />Happy Chinese new year~<br /><br />I also have the same question about what is medium structure activity. But thanks to Teddy and Circle's answer, I have more understanding about this term. I will go back to the key readings later.<br /><br />Regarding the second question, I think that the high structure or low structure activities are just attributes of the activity itself. It may be the sequential arrangement of these activities that leads to the different levels of learning outcomes. As you said, according to the four broad Sequences presented by Jacobson et al. (2013), they are high-high, low-low, low-high and high-low. So, if different levels of activities are combined in different ways, there will be different effects. For example, LH sequence allows learners to better deep learning and transfer knowledge to new problem-solving scenarios. HH sequence might involve direct instruction followed by a worked example, etc. Zhaohui mentioned that high level learning outcomes are more likely to correspond with low level structure activity. I think this statement is easily misunderstood. The activity level and the learning outcome level are not simply one-to-one correspondence. For the learning goals of different courses, the sequence of different level activities may be the bullet point.<br /><br />Reference:<br />Jacobson, M., Kim, B., Pathak, S., &amp; Zhang, B. (2013).

The results show that, without changing thecontent, simply changing the order of tasks can have a huge impact. This isalso an important content mentioned in Session4. LH structure helps learnersbegin with an idea generation and exploration phase where learners work onsolving a complex problem that may encourage them to think critically about theproblem and identify knowledge gaps. And the use of the HL sequence will result instudents not being able to conduct in-depth learning well and use theknowledge to solve problems in new problem scenarios.

Then the difference between learners hasan impact on the course design. For example, what adult learners need islearning content that can solve their real problems, and they may not haveenough time compared with young children. But when we use the LH structure, itseems that learners need to spend a certain amount of time thinking andexploring in order to find the knowledge gap in the early stage. In terms ofadult learners, will the inquiry requirements in LH structure and learners'time limitation conflict? Or how can the balance be between the two?</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">\u00a0</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">Second, low structure component refers togiving students the opportunity to explore and find the knowledge gap. In thisweek\u2019s quiz question, \"quiz\" is high structure activity. Butconsidering the learning design of MITE6330, I found that when we complete the quiz every week, we will experience failure first, and then spend a lot of timeexploring.

The medium refers to not just high or just low but combines the high and the low. Take the \" Group discussion during class time\" as an example. When students discuss, they are in the low structure component, because this is a process about idea generation and exploration. After they end the discussion, they will get feedback from the teacher, or get ideas from their classmates, this is the process for them to board the knowledge, it's a high component.

For example, students needto learn vocabulary or grammar before they can read a passage, which is HLstructure.

And LL could be effective to guide high-quality learnerswith great knowledge who are also high self-directed. </span></p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">Hope my views could help you with this questionand welcome more discussion.</span><br />", "messageformat": "1", "messagetrust": "0", "attachment": null, "totalscore": "0", "mailnow": "0", "privatereplyto": "0", "ratings": null}]}, "discussion_subs": {"discussion_sub": [{"@id": "7841", "userid": "7994", "preference": "1613839974"}, {"@id": "7851", "userid": "8013", "preference": "1613920436"}, {"@id": "7956", "userid": "7557", "preference": "1614446987"}]}}, {"@id": "9564", "name": "Question on cognitive LOs", "firstpost": "30251", "userid": "8012", "groupid": "-1", "assessed": "0", "timemodified": "1613987993", "usermodified": "8015", "timestart": "0", "timeend": "0", "pinned": "0", "timelocked": "0", "posts": {"post": [{"@id": "30251", "parent": "0", "userid": "8012", "created": "1613912953", "modified": "1613912975", "mailed": "1", "subject": "Question on cognitive LOs", "message": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align:left;\">What is the difference between learning outcomes and cognitive learning outcomes?

I have exactly the same question as you hahaha. In my view, I think cognitive learning outcomes could help us to identify the difficulties of the tasks which could help us better arrange our task sequence and design the learning resources.  Learners may resist doing the \" tasks that involve high-level cognitive processing and try to simplify the demands of the situation through negotiation\", which may reduce the engagement of learners (Blumenfeld et al., 1991). In this situation, the design of the task sequence and the resources to support students learning become critical. If students don't have enough prior knowledge which raises their difficulty in finishing the task, we may need to add a task that imparts prior knowledge first. Besides, to reduce the cognitive processing difficulty or to scaffold learners to achieve higher cognitive learning outcomes, we may provide learners with learning resources. <br /><br />Blumenfeld, P.

Originally, these terms seem onlynotions to me that I fit our work into their definition. However, because Dr. Nancypointed out that our DP (computational thinking cycle) seems not to suit our learningdesign and the CT cycle can\u2019t be a DP also, I started to think that what is therole of DP in our learning design.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">I reviewedour task sequence and found basically we considered two aspects when we design thetasks that 1) how we will process the teaching and 2) what kinds of content wewill teach here. For the process of teaching, we referred to the PA we choice whilefor the content teaching question, we were guided by the DP. When we choose PA,we considered 1) the learning environment that whether we have enough technologiesor teachers to support the teaching process, 2) the age of target learner thatwhether the PA is suitable to use (would it be too hard for the learners)and so on. However, to make sure the knowledge could be learnt in a rightsequence according to the cognitive processing, DP could have a more specificinstruction.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">Meanwhile,I learnt LH structure and productive failure (PF) from the reading and startedto think about the cognitive processing in the learning design. Actually,before learning the sequence of pedagogical structure, I met the problems that 1)for some tasks, I don\u2019t know how to classify the role of them in the mini-coursedesign and 2) don\u2019t have a clear idea about task sequence though the termappeared many times in the previous lecture.</span></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">For example,we want students to explore Scratch before learning the actual knowledge about blocks.Though I know the process of exploration could help students to learn theknowledge, I don\u2019t know how the single task enhances knowledge learning exactly.Here using the task sequence, it seems easier for me to identify the LO if Icombine the \u201cexploration\u201d and \u201cdirect teaching\u201d tasks together. It is a little similarto the LH structure when we design the activities that we include differentactivities to achieve one or more learning outcomes. In all, I don\u2019t know whetherit is right or not, it seems that some tasks could be better explained if weanalyze them from a task sequence perspective.</span></p><p><b><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">Learning Journal</span></b></p><p><span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">In thisweek, for the quiz, I met a problem that whether the multiple attempt quiz belongsto low structure activity.

I\u2019mprone to classify the articles and PowerPoint as resources to scaffold thelearning process instead of direct teaching. Meanwhile, for the simple quiz,students won\u2019t have the productive failure experience because it could be only attendedonce whereas learner could try many times in multiple attempt quiz. There is nopunishment if we got a low score at first or attempt too many times. Instead,students are encouraged to figure out the answer by many times attempt andlearn from the failure.

The problem your mentioned is very common in education nowadays. As an educator, trying to foster students' intrinsic motivation is a continuous point that we should concentrate beside teaching knowledge to students. Obviously, extrinsic motivation can not last forever. It may last a period time, such as a lesson or a session. In my opinion, when we teach some abstract and difficult concepts, extrinsic motivation is effective for a while, so that we can set this kind of motivation based on the students' characteristics. However, the important thing is that we should help our students realize it is meaningful to learn. Like Maslow's hierarchy of needs, self-actualization needs can  only be realized after their physiological needs, safety needs, Love and belonging needs, and esteem needs are realized. At that time, students will have the intrinsic motivation which can last forever.</div>", "messageformat": "1", "messagetrust": "0", "attachment": null, "totalscore": "0", "mailnow": "0", "privatereplyto": "0", "ratings": null}, {"@id": "30381", "parent": "30370", "userid": "7994", "created": "1614485654", "modified": "1614605060", "mailed": "1", "subject": "Re: The motivation behind \"learning from mistakes\"", "message": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align:left;\"><span lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\"><span><span>Hi, Amy!

Some students value their grades, but some of them don't care. So your question \"can extrinsic motivation last forever?\", I think it is difficult to make a complete assumption. Because even if some students have experienced a lot of PF, they will still keep as high engagement as possible during the course (students who are very influenced by extrinsic motivation).<br /><br />For how to sustain the motivation of students while they experiencing PF, according to Keller's ARCS model, I think it\u2019s a good way to set up hands on inquiry activities. If we provide learners some hands on activities, then we can effectively maintain student motivation. Take 6330 as an example. During the course, the group of students is allowed to complete their own course design, which is a kind of hands on inquiry activity. In addition, using real-world examples in teaching is also one of the methods.<br /><br />In addition, as for the intrinsic motivation you mentioned, in addition to interest and enjoyment, it also involves satisfaction.

I think your question is quite interesting to consider. Students at different ages have different characteristics. Of course, learning from failure cannot be a large part of the learning design, otherwise students will lose interest in learning as they continue to encounter mistakes. Motivating students to learn means that students feel joy, accomplishment, or satisfaction in the learning process. Regarding how to stimulate students' intrinsic motivation, I think that students can be given timely and positive feedback on their learning, and students can see their progress in this process of learning through failure, so that students' sense of achievement in learning is also satisfied.

Make sure that the pattern is similar to the situation as much as possible, which will bring great convenience and ensure coherence. <br />Actually, I don't think it should be a concern for a green hand learning designer to worry about the coherence of the pattern. Because the pattern itself is already a handy tool and easy to follow. What's more, my other point is that a pattern is simply a reference for designing the process. It can help to build a simple structure at the very beginning. But overall speaking, the details of the learning design should strongly target the LO, which is the ultimate goal.

Therefore, the \"Change in teaching and assessment\" is for the current batch. <br /><br />I classified \"Method\" as part of the LA because it tells what and how to collect the data while \"Change in teaching and assessment\" as part of the LD because teaching and assessment are part of the course design.  Adopting the TISL-heart model, you may realise the existing course design may not provide the necessary data as you defined in the \"Method\" part.  As a result, you need to modify you course design (\"Change in teaching and assessment\") in order to obtain the data you need before implementing the course to collect student data.  Once the student data are collected and analysed, the results are fed into \"Feedback\" to generate new questions and assumptions.<br /><br />PS.

Yet what we need to do is to minimise the biases. For example, to avoid social desirability bias in questionnaire - i.e. people might not be shy to answer their true response (e.g. I learn sth rather than not learn anything.
